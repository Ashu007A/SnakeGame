# Technologies used
Java: The code is written in the Java programming language. Java is a popular programming language used for developing a wide range of applications.

Swing: The code imports the javax.swing package, which is part of Java's Swing framework. Swing is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Java, used for creating desktop applications with a graphical interface.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): The code imports the java.awt package, which is part of Java's AWT framework. AWT provides the basic set of tools for creating user interfaces in Java, including components, graphics, and events.

ActionListener: The code implements the ActionListener interface, which is part of the AWT and Swing frameworks. It is used to handle action events, such as button clicks or timer events.

Timer: The code uses the Timer class from the javax.swing package. The Timer class is used to schedule and control the timing of events in Swing applications.

KeyAdapter and KeyEvent: The code imports the java.awt.event.KeyAdapter and java.awt.event.KeyEvent classes. These classes are used for handling keyboard events. The KeyAdapter class provides default implementations for keyboard event handling methods, and the KeyEvent class represents a key press or release event.

ImageIcon: The code uses the ImageIcon class from the javax.swing package to load and manage image icons.

JFrame: The JFrame class is a part of the Swing library and represents a window in a GUI application. It provides methods and properties for managing the window's appearance and behavior.

Board: The code references a custom class called "Board." Without the definition of the Board class, it's not possible to determine the specific technologies used within that class. However, based on the code provided, it is likely that the Board class is responsible for rendering the game board and handling the game logic.

Overall, the code combines various Java technologies such as Swing, AWT, timers, and event handling to create a simple game board with graphics and user interaction.
